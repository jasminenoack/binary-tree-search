# Ruby Meetup (December 3, 2014)
Task: Implement a Binary Search Tree class

# Steps
1. Clone this repo `git clone git@github.com:Clee681/binary-search-tree.git`
2. Run your spec file with `$ ruby binary_search_tree_test.rb`
3. Get the first spec to pass *Hint: you need to create a file named `bst.rb` to get past the first error*
4. Unskip the next spec and repeat step 2
